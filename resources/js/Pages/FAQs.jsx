          question: "What is OK BY OWNER?",
          answer: "OK BY OWNER is Oklahoma's leading For Sale By Owner (FSBO) platform that allows homeowners to list, market, and sell their properties without paying traditional realtor commissions. We provide all the tools and support you need to sell your home successfully."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I get started listing my property?",
          answer: "Simply click on 'List Your Property' button, create a free account, and follow our step-by-step listing process. You'll add property details, upload photos, set your price, and your listing will be live within minutes."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need to be a licensed realtor to use OK BY OWNER?",
          answer: "No, you don't need any license or real estate experience. OK BY OWNER is specifically designed for homeowners who want to sell their property themselves. We provide all the guidance and tools you need."
        },
        {
          question: "What areas does OK BY OWNER serve?",
          answer: "We serve all of Oklahoma, including major cities like Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Norman, Broken Arrow, Edmond, and all surrounding areas throughout the state."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Pricing & Fees',
      icon: DollarSign,
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "How much does it cost to list my property?",
          answer: "Our basic listing is completely FREE! You can list your property, upload photos, and connect with buyers at no cost. We also offer premium packages with additional features like professional photography, virtual tours, and enhanced marketing."
        },
        {
          question: "Are there any hidden fees?",
          answer: "Absolutely not. We believe in complete transparency. Our free listing is truly free with no hidden charges. Premium features are clearly priced upfront, and you only pay for what you choose to use."
        },
        {
          question: "How much money can I save by selling FSBO?",
          answer: "Traditional real estate commissions typically range from 5-6% of your home's sale price. On a $300,000 home, that's $15,000-$18,000 in commissions. By selling with OK BY OWNER, you keep that money in your pocket."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need to offer a buyer's agent commission?",
          answer: "While not required, offering a buyer's agent commission (typically 2.5-3%) can significantly increase your property's exposure since many buyers work with agents. You decide what commission, if any, to offer."
        }

      title: 'Listings & Marketing',
      icon: FileText,
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "What is an MLS flat-fee listing?",
          answer: "An MLS flat-fee listing is a service that allows you to list your property on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) for a one-time flat fee instead of paying a percentage-based commission to a traditional real estate agent. This gives you access to thousands of potential buyers through the MLS while saving significantly on commission costs."
        },
        {
          question: "Will my listing appear on Zillow, Trulia, and Realtor.com?",
          answer: "Yes! With our MLS integration package, your listing will automatically syndicate to major real estate websites including Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, and many others, giving your property maximum exposure."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does my listing stay active?",
          answer: "Your listing stays active until you sell your property or choose to remove it. There are no time limits on our free listings. Premium MLS listings typically run for 6 months and can be renewed."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I edit my listing after it's published?",
          answer: "Yes! You have complete control over your listing and can update details, change photos, adjust pricing, or modify any information at any time through your account dashboard."
        },
        {
          question: "What photos should I include in my listing?",
          answer: "Include at least 10-15 high-quality photos showing exterior views, all main rooms, kitchen, bathrooms, special features, and outdoor spaces. Good lighting and clean, decluttered spaces make the best impression. We also offer professional photography services."
        }

      title: 'Selling Process',
      icon: Users,
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "How do buyers contact me about my property?",
          answer: "Buyers and their agents can contact you directly through the contact information you provide in your listing. You'll receive inquiries via phone, email, or through our messaging system, and you can respond on your own schedule."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I schedule and conduct showings myself?",
          answer: "Yes! You have complete control over showings. You can schedule them at times that work for you and show the property yourself. Many sellers find this gives them the opportunity to highlight their home's best features directly to potential buyers."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens when I receive an offer?",
          answer: "When you receive an offer, you can review it and choose to accept, reject, or counter. We provide resources and templates to help you through the negotiation process. Many sellers also consult with a real estate attorney for major transactions."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need a lawyer to sell my home FSBO?",
          answer: "While not legally required in Oklahoma, we highly recommend consulting with a real estate attorney, especially for the closing process. An attorney can review contracts, ensure proper documentation, and protect your interests. The cost is minimal compared to traditional commissions."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does it typically take to sell a FSBO property?",
          answer: "Sale times vary based on pricing, location, condition, and market conditions. Properties listed on the MLS and priced competitively typically sell within 30-90 days. Proper pricing, good photos, and being responsive to inquiries are key to a quick sale."
        },
        {
          question: "What paperwork do I need to sell my home?",
          answer: "You'll need a purchase agreement, seller's disclosure form, title documents, and closing documents. We provide templates for many of these documents, and your closing attorney or title company will handle much of the paperwork."
