    // Free Listing FAQs
    {
      category: "Free Listing",
      question: "How long has OKByOwner.com been around?",
      answer: "We have been helping sellers market their homes since 1997."
    },
    {
      category: "Free Listing",
      question: "Why is it free to list on OK By Owner?",
      answer: "Unlike other national websites that let you list for free, only to give your buyer leads to paying real estate agents. Should you decide to upgrade to professional photos, multimedia, or the MLS, you'll use us, like hundreds of other successful for-sale-by-owners."
    },
    // Multimedia FAQs
    {
      category: "Multimedia",
      question: "What is the normal turnaround time after the photographer takes the photos? And do I own the multimedia?",
      answer: "You can expect a 24-hour turnaround time. Yes, all multimedia is yours to share on other websites."
    },
    // Flat Fee MLS FAQs
    {
      category: "Flat Fee MLS",
      question: "Why should I list on the MLS?",
      answer: "Listing on the MLS dramatically increases your chances of getting your house sold faster. 96.5% of our sellers who have listed and sold on the MLS were referred by a buyer's agent who found the listing on the MLS."
    },
    {
      category: "Flat Fee MLS",
      question: "Do I have to pay a buyer's agent a commission?",
      answer: "No, all commissions are negotiable, as are the price and other terms of an offer. While some buyers may pay their agent directly, others prefer the commission to be paid by the seller, with the commission rolled into the price. It's worth noting that buyers may instruct their agent only to show properties where the seller offers a commission to the buyer's agent."
    },
    {
      category: "Flat Fee MLS",
      question: "How long does it take for my property to be listed on the MLS?",
      answer: "Once all paperwork is complete and photos are delivered, you will be listed within two business days. Once listed, you will receive a link to your listing with the MLS number. Payment will be due after you are listed. You can pay by Cash, Check, Credit Card, PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App."
    },
    {
      category: "Flat Fee MLS",
      question: "Can I cancel my MLS listing at any time?",
      answer: "Yes. You can cancel your listing at any time if you are not under contract with an agent representing a buyer."
