      question: "What is an MLS flat-fee listing?",
      answer: "An MLS flat-fee listing is a service that allows you to list your property on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) for a one-time flat fee instead of paying a percentage-based commission to a traditional real estate agent. This gives you access to thousands of potential buyers through the MLS while saving significantly on commission costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Why should I list on the MLS?",
      answer: "Listing on the MLS gives your property maximum exposure to potential buyers and real estate agents. The MLS is the primary database used by real estate professionals, and properties listed on the MLS typically sell faster and for better prices than those marketed through other channels alone."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I personally list my home on the MLS without a realtor?",
      answer: "Yes, with our flat-fee MLS service, you can list your home on the MLS without hiring a traditional full-service realtor. We provide you with the tools and support needed to list your property while you maintain control of the selling process and save thousands in commission fees."
    },
    {
      question: "What does \"realtor-friendly\" mean?",
      answer: "Realtor-friendly means that while you're selling your home by owner, you're still willing to work with buyer's agents and offer them a commission. This ensures that realtors will show your property to their clients, giving you access to a much larger pool of potential buyers."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take for my property to be listed on the MLS?",
      answer: "Once you complete your listing information and submit all required details and photos, your property is typically listed on the MLS within 24-48 hours. The exact timeline may vary slightly depending on the local MLS processing times."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel my MLS listing at any time?",
      answer: "Yes, you have the flexibility to cancel your MLS listing at any time. However, we recommend maintaining your listing for at least 90 days to give your property adequate market exposure and the best chance of selling at your desired price."
